## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

### Expected Behaviour

#### All Pages

- When the "Get Scootin" call-to-action in the header is clicked, scroll down to the app download section at the bottom of the page

#### Home

- When the "Get Scootin" call-to-action in the intro section is clicked, scroll down to the app download section at the bottom of the page
- When the "Learn More" call-to-action is clicked in the "Easy to use riding telemetry" component navigate to the About page
- When the "Learn More" call-to-action is clicked in the "Coming to a city near you" component navigate to the Locations page
- When the "Learn More" call-to-action is clicked in the "Zero hassle payments" component navigate to the About page

#### Careers

- When the "Say Hello" and "Apply" call-to-actions are clicked, don't navigate anywhere

#### Locations

- When the "Message Us" call-to-action is clicked, don't navigate anywhere
