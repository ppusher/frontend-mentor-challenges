## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this testimonials grid section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## Built with

- HTML 
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

## Experience,  Challenges and Learning
Simple and quick challenge, the layout was easy to follow. I kept the mobile(375px) and desktop (1440px) design as close to provided the design specs as possible but experimented with various layout styles in media queries with the power of CSS Grid.
