## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Animations

## Experience, Challenges and Learning

Layout was simple but tedious compared to newbie challenges. Footer had weird quirks mostly because of my markup decisions.
The javascript for two email validations need to be worked on yet which seems a little different from previous challenges.

There also seems to be a horizontal scroll on Chrome and not on Firefox, haven't found the problem yet.
