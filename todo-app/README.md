# Todo app solution

This is a solution to the [Todo app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW).

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

## Experience and Challenges 

### Built with

#### Frontend
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- React - JS library
- Axios
- Redux
- Redux Toolkit(RTK)

#### Backend
- Nodejs
- Expressjs
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

#### Tooling
- ViteJS

### What I learned and continued development

This is an unnecessarily complex implementation of a Todo app. The technologies used for this todo app are overkill and I am fully aware but the best way to reinforce what you have learned is by using it to build something. 
So here we are, an overengineered Todo App.

This app uses React for the frontend with Redux and Redux Toolkit for state management. 

Usage of onMouse events   
The hack for axios delete, backend delete route and deleteMany

_WIP_ - Currently being used as project brain dump, a project todolist, a rough draft for everything I learn and/or want to add to README while building it.
