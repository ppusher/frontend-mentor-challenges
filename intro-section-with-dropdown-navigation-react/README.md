## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this intro section with dropdown navigation and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Experience and Challenges

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 mark-up
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- ViteJS

### What I learned and continuous development

The navigation in react and styled components together was a little tricky to understand. Especially handling the dropdown nav items. 
I ended up creating a data file for dropdown items to handle them easily but I am not sure this is the correct approach to it.
The mobile nav can be drastically improved.
