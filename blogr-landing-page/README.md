## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript

## Experience, Challenges and Learning

The various elements of the page were a bit challenging and I struggled throughout the challenge to get them match the design specs especially the images.

The nested navigation items needed proper planning which I clearly did not think through properly so had to redo most of the navbar markup while doing the CSS and then some more when I did the javascript for it.
