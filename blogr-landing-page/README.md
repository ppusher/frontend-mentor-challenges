## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript

## Experience, Challenges and Learning

_This will be updated periodically while the pending tasks are being worked on._

The various elements of the page were a bit challegning and I struggled throughout the challenge to get them match the design specs especially the iamges.
The nest navigation items needed proper planning which I clearly did not think through properly so had to redo most of the navbar markup while doing the CSS and then some more when I did the javascript for it.

##### Pending tasks

- Fix the overflow-x
- Navbar bug > each dropdown item opens on click but doesn't close when clicked on itself. Closes when clicked on any other nav item.
