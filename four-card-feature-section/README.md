## Experience

This challenge was simpler than any of the previous challenges, Flexbox is powerful for such cards, helps centering everything in less lines of code. At first I wanted to use grid but the offset boxes made it difficult to have a proper grid. 

## Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Flexbox
