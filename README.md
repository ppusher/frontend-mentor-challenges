# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank for checking out this Frontend Mentor Challenges Repo.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

This repo is single mega repo for all my submissions for the Frontend Mentor Challenges.
Challenges on FrontendMentor are categorised based on a difficulty level. So I am just using the same to categorise them.

The earlier challenges are vanilla JS projects and the later ones are in React. I have titled them to easily find them.

The goal of this challenge is to keep coding everyday even if the progress of the project is in small increments and learn and experiment new things along the way. I try to document my process, my difficulties and what I learned from each project in the project's repo. I would appreciate any feedback you have for me.
