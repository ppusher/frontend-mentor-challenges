## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this data storage component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Animations

### Experience, Challenges and Learning

The layout was simple. Challenge was short and easy to finish. This component had elements which inspired some animations to play with. 
CSS Animations still need more reading, the current animations I do to any challenge are very fast and mostly end up being similar to my previous attempt at CSS Animations.
