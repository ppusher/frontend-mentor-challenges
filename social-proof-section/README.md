## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## Experience

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I am used to starting with the desktop view first so tried the mobile first approach. At first it felt really easy but this challenge had a unique desktop view which meant I had to do a lot of things  in the media queries which felt a little backwards as I am not used to this type of work flow. 

### Challenges

I am learning a lof about manipulating background images in CSS with the  vast number of unique properties it has but I still failed to position them to match the design. 

Mobile first is something either I will embrace or reject, I am not sure yet. I had to rewrite a lot of CSS properties after I started writing the media queries.
