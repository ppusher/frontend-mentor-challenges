 ## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size


## Experience

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I like working the desktop view first but tried the mobile first approach. At first it felt really easy but this challenge had a unique desktop view which meant I had to work everything backwards in media queries as I am not used to this type of work flow. 


### Challenges

Background images in CSS has vast number of unique properties but I still failed to position them exactly to match the design. 

Mobile first is something either I will embrace or reject, I am not sure yet. I had to rewrite a lot of CSS properties after I started writing the media queries.
