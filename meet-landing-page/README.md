## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## Built with 
- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

## Experience & Challenges

The challenge took time but had a very detailed layout. Enjoyed this challenge. I wasn't able to get the hero background image to look exactly like the design specs but its very close to it. There is a small bug with my footer overlay which causes the footer items to have a huge margin, not sure what caused that but I fixed that with negative margins which isn't the best way but fixes the bug.
